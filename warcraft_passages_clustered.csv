arthas,https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arthas_Menethil,"Despite his promising beginnings, Arthas became one of the most powerful and evil beings Azeroth would ever know. Although he killed the necromancer Kel'Thuzad, Arthas was unable to stop the spread of the plague and resorted to increasingly desperate methods, such as purging the city of Stratholme. Taking up the cursed runeblade Frostmourne, Arthas was able to defeat the demon Mal'Ganis, but he lost his soul in the process. Becoming a death knight of the Scourge, he led the undead in destroying Lordaeron, Quel'Thalas, and Dalaran. Arthas later made his way to the Frozen Throne of Icecrown and merged with the Lich King.[9]

Arthas killed two paladins, Ballador the Bright and Sage Truthbearer, who both condemned Arthas' betrayal.

The two engaged in a duel with Uther initially having the upper hand, knocking Arthas down and sending Frostmourne flying from his hands. As Arthas awaited the killing blow, the sword seemed to find its own way into his hands and he was granted more power by the Lich King. The battle began to turn in Arthas' favor. Eventually, Uther, covered in blood from his wounds, fell to his knees and told Arthas he hoped there was a special place in hell waiting for him. Arthas replied that they would never know because he intended to live forever, then delivered the killing blow.

from Auchindoun and still he was weak. His power had not returned to anything like
what it had been before his use of the soul siphon.

It did not matter. Illidan resented being here, resented having to go through with this
charade. Every minute spent placating his advisers was a minute not used finalizing his
plans to end the threat of the Burning Legion. He forced himself to look around the

Suddenly he was tired of all this. He was tired of listening to this petty, pointless
bickering over matters that were no longer of any concern to him. He was tired of the
