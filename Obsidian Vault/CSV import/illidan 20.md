text: "Consumed with nothing but his mission to plot the downfall of Argus, Illidan had lost all interest in holding onto Outland. This attitude wouldn't change until the eve of the Black Temple's fall when Illidan witnessed the flow of the battle and understood at once that this clash of the Legion's enemies was what Kil'jaeden had anticipated. The Betrayer ordered the Illidari Council to retreat and prepare for battle, freshly resolved to both win this battle and finish his own personal strike at the Legion's heart.[50] Illidan, however, was still focused on his larger goal.
