text: "Archimonde left a trio of dreadlords behind in the ruined palace gardens of Lordaeron to ensure that the nation remained under control, and to watch over the cunning servitors of Ner'zhul. When the demon lord was defeated, however, they were not originally aware of it. This changed several months later, when Arthas returned to reclaim his throne. He threatened the dreadlords, who immediately fled, and then called Sylvanas and Kel'Thuzad to his side to stop a large group of human refugees, who were led by the paladins Halahk the Lifebringer, Magroth the Defender, and Dagren the Orcslayer as they tried to stall the Scourge so they could escape into the canyons, where the undead would have difficulty hunting them. However, during the climax of the battle, Arthas had a painful seizure, and felt the Lich King calling out to him. Despite his diminished powers, Arthas fought on until all the humans in the area were killed.[43]"
