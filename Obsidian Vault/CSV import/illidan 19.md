text: "Meanwhile, Akama had grown increasingly frustrated over Illidan's refusal to relinquish control of the Black Temple (formerly known to Akama's people as the Temple of Karabor). In addition to his army of fel orcs, Illidan had begun training an army of demon hunters — imbued with the same demonic powers as Illidan himself and wielding warglaives similar to his own. This army would come to be known as the Illidari. Believing that Illidan's work with the fel orcs — whose kin Akama had fought against for so long — and the fel rituals undergone by the Illidari served only to defile the Temple further, Akama began to secretly conspire with Maiev Shadowsong in an attempt to free Outland from Illidan's grasp. It was not long, however, before Illidan discovered Akama's betrayal. Rather than kill the Broken warrior for his treachery, Illidan chose instead to bind a portion of Akama's soul into his service; ensuring that Akama could still be used in the future for Illidan's own purposes."
