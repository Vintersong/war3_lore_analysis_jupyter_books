text: "Thrall later once again donned the Doomhammer plate armor and traveled to Keeper's Respite in Korthia. There, the soul of his mother Draka—who had become a baroness of Maldraxxus after her death—was preparing to attack the fortress Desmotaeron in the Maw alongside a Maw Walker in order to deal with two of the Jailer's lieutenants, Helya and Baron Vyraz. Thrall asked to join them on their mission and accompanied the two to Desmotaeron.[131] As they fought their way through the Mawsworn, Thrall and Draka asked each other questions about their lives,[132] but when he tried to tell her that he was her son, she cut him off and told him to focus on the mission.[133] During the fighting, Thrall asked the Maw Walker to help him retrieve Dra'gora from Helya's minion Weaponmaster Hyrev, since the axe reminded him of his family and he wanted to feel its weight in his hands again.[98] After summoning a series of death gates throughout the fortress,[134] the trio summoned the necropolis Zerekriss and allowed the united covenants to begin an assault on Desmotaeron.[135] With the Mawsworn in lower Desmotaeron combating the invaders, Thrall, Draka, and the Maw Walker breached the upper part of the fortress and confronted Vyraz and Helya. Helya empowered Vyraz with her boon, but the Primus of Maldraxxus teleported in and gave Draka his own blessing, allowing the group to defeat the baron and the Primus to banish Helya.[136]"
