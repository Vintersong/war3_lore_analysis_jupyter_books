text: Arthas also draws parallels with Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. Anakin is another prominent example of the "fallen hero" archetype in modern fiction. Like Anakin, Arthas began his career as a promising knight sworn to altruism and justice, under the tutelage of an experienced warrior who attempted to instill these values in his pupil. Both men were eventually seduced by dark powers, and aided in the destruction of their orders and the killing of their mentors.  Both began their descent to villainy with massacres (Arthas' Culling of Stratholme and Anakin either when he wiped out the Tusken Raider tribe that killed his mother or purged the Jedi Temple after becoming Darth Vader).  Both ended their lives not as Darth Vader or the Lich King, but as Anakin Skywalker and Arthas Menethil, respectively. One key difference though was at the end of their lives; where as Vader redeemed himself and became Anakin by destroying his master to save his son Luke, Arthas had no such redemption given to him.
