Huge wings draped his back. Yellow demonic runes glared on his\nbracers. In his right hand he clutched a gigantic black blade on which runes pulsed in\nsubdued blue. The sword looked large enough to take down an Ashenvale oak with one\nswipe.\n“So you are the one who defeated Magtheridon,” the demon said. “You don’t look\nlike much.”\nH"
