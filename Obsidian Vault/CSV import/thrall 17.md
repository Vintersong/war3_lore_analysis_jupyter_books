text: "When Garrosh Hellscream and his soldiers finally returned home from Northrend, Thrall held a banquet in the young orc's honor and presented him with Gorehowl, also authorizing bonfires to be lit in Orgrimmar. Thrall held a speech of problems about the turbulence of nature and also of financial ones. It was decided that Hamuul would go to a meeting with the Cenarion Circle in order to get help for the Horde. Now, it was impossible to trade with the Alliance's night elves due to estrangement. Unfortunately Durotar had been suffering a very severe drought causing one of the bonfires to become a conflagration that destroyed several buildings. Thrall himself tried to calm the flames using his shamanic powers but found that the fire was hell-bent on destruction, resolving to snuff out the flames forcibly, an act he regretted. He realized that something was very wrong with the elements and that they were out of control, and pondered the situation."
