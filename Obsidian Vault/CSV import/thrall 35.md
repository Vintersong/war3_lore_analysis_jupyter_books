text: "After the failed battle, Thrall reunited with Aggra and his son Durak in Dalaran. Thrall asked shaman adventurers to meet at the Maelstrom in an attempt to gather the remaining Earthen Ring members who survived the battle. Thrall and Farseer Nobundo believed that they needed powerful artifacts in order to overcome the Legion threat. Unfortunately, the Legion led by the Fel Lord Geth'xun found them before they could form plans. The Earthen Ring were able to repel the demons' assault, but Thrall lost the Doomhammer during the fight, which fell into Deepholm with Geth'xun. Thrall, Stormcaller Mylra and the shaman adventurer immediately went after it."
