text: "The Doomhammer is a powerful hammer that was crafted long ago in a pool of elemental lava[2] on the orc homeworld of Draenor. It is a namesake relic passed down from father to son,[3] and was given to Thrall as a testament of faith and honor during the salvation of the orcs.[4] Although the hilt of the hammer has been replaced, the actual hammerhead itself has endured as a testament of the crafter's skill."
