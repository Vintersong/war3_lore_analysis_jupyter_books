text: "Halfway along their journey to Kalimdor, Thrall's ships were beset by a fierce storm near the Maelstrom and forced to take shelter on a small island. There the orcs met the troll leader, Sen'jin, who told them of a human outpost that attacked his tribe night and day on the island. Fearing for the Horde and the Darkspear Trolls' safety, Thrall and his warriors assaulted the human base. During his stay, he reactivated a Fountain of Health and discovered that the isle had active volcanos. Aided by the Darkspear trolls, the human leader, an archmage, was killed, but then many murlocs attacked the Horde, the humans, and the Darkspear trolls. While the orcish and human forces were occupied with one another, the piscine monsters sought out sacrifices for their rituals.[23]"
