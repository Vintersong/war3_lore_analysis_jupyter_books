text: "Young Orgrim came to admire the hammer, knowning one day it would be his own.[3] In a meeting between Orgrim, Durotan, and the draenei prophet Velen, Orgrim told of a prophecy about the Doomhammer saying that \"The last of the Doomhammer line will use it to bring first salvation and then doom to the orc people. Then it will pass into the hands of one who is not of the Blackrock clan, all will change again, and it will once again be used in the cause of justice.\"[3][6]"
