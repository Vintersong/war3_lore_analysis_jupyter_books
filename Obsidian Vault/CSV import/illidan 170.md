He turned just as his assailant was\nabout to drive the weapons into his back. With one hand he caught him by the throat.\nWith a word of power, he ignited his foe’s flesh with persistent fire and cast him aside\nto burn dow n to blackened bon es.\nAn arrow flashed toward Illidan’s head. He turned so it glanced off his horn. A\ngigantic hunting beast bounded right at him."
