text: "Illidan had heard only rumors of the Highborne's fate. Illidan cast a powerful spell and called the naga to the surface, calling in some old Highborne debts.[34] A group of naga led by Lady Vashj emerged from the depths and pledged themselves to him. They did not come because of their shared history, nor did they respect his demonic power. They came because the Old Gods willed it. They noticed Illidan and his hunger for power. They sent the naga to aid Illidan in his campaign against the Lich King so that it could spark a new war. If the former night elf became troublesome, the Old Gods could simply command the naga to cut out his fel-corrupted heart.[35]"
