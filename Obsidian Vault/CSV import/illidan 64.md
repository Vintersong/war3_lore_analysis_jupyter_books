text: "Akama placed his hands together and made a bow that set his facial tentacles to\ntouching the ground. Illidan spread his arms wide, and his wings wider still, and\nbrandished a Warglaive of Azzinoth in each fist. He chanted words, and the forces of\nmagic bent to his will. Magtheridon struggled against his bindings, enormous muscles\nflexing as he tried the strength of his chains. It seemed that the pit lord was not quite as\nsanguine as he tried to appear at the prospect of the bloodletting.\nIllidan"
