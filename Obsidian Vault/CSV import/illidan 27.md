text: "At the heart of the Legion's stronghold, the Coven of Shivarra are torturing the Pantheon (excluding Eonar and Aggramar). Magni can feel the demons twisting the spirits of them; forcing them to use their might to serve the Legion. Should they fall into darkness, Illidan says, Sargeras will have the power he needs to claim the final titan Azeroth. After Aggramar is defeated and his soul returns to the rest of his brethren, Illidan reminds everyone (Magni included) that our victories mean nothing. So long as Sargeras has the soul of Argus to fuel his infinite army, Azeroth remains in grave peril."
