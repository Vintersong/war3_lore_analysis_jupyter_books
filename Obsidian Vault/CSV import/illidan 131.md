text: "Their enemies were too numerous and too powerful, and they were merely throwing\naway resources that would be needed to defend the Black Temple when the final attack\ncame.\nIllidan’s boast that he was going to take the war to Kil’jaeden also seemed pointless\nnow, no more threatening than a child dressing up in his father’s armor and waving his\nfather’s sword would be to a veteran soldier.\nVandel looked from face to face. Illidan’s wore a sneer, as if this whole vast army\nwas beneath his contempt."
