text: "Thrall then witnessed those who had overcome Domination in the past draw out the memories of their resistance and willpower and infuse it into the shards. After Bolvar declared that they had all the pieces they needed and that it was time for Primus to reforge the helm, Jaina directly opened a portal to Torghast and the group used it to reach the Runecarver's Oubliette.[145] As the Primus began to reforge the helm, Thrall questioned what was to stop the helm from being used to enslave others, to which the Primus answered that it was \"to become something greater. An instrument of free will.\" Thrall subsequently witnessed the Primus reforge the helm into the Crown of Wills, which was quickly used to ensure that the group was resistant to Domination."
