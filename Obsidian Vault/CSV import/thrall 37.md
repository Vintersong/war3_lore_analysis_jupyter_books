text: "Thrall and his family retired to a quiet farm near Oshu'gun in Nagrand. While there, he crafted a new weapon—an axe named Dra'gora—and hid it in a secret compartment under the ground, because part of him knew that there would come a day when he would have to return to the fight.[97][98] Although a world away and cut off from his connection to the powers of a shaman, Thrall felt the moment when Sylvanas Windrunner burned Teldrassil: he heard a quiet, distant, collective cry and briefly tasted smoke on the air.[99]"
