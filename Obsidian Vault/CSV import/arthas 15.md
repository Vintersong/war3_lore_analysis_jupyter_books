text: "Anduin was forced to follow the Jailer to the Sepulcher of the First Ones and try to waylay the heroes of Azeroth, including Jaina, Uther, and Sylvanas. During the battle, the adventurers helped restore Anduin's willpower, allowing him to periodically manifest the Remnant of a Fallen King from the sword. Ultimately, however, Anduin was able to free himself from the Jailer's control and shatter Kingsmourne back into Shalamayne, freeing the remnant of Arthas: a faintly glowing flicker, consumed in the forges of the Jailer, with not even enough of a soul left to receive a proper judgment. Sylvanas stated that despite her hatred, she had become no better than her nemesis in her pursuit of vengeance and that she would have to answer for this, but that Arthas' own legacy was now at an end. She told the remnant \"May the last whisper of your name fade and be forgotten\", and the heroes looked on in silence as this last part of Arthas Menethil faded away forever.[78]"
