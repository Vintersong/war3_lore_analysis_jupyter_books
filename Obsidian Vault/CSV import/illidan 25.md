text: "Gul'dan sought to use Illidan's body as a vessel for Sargeras' spirit, and so Xe'ra and the Illidari planned to return Illidan's soul to his body before it was too late.[62] Allari the Souleater constructed a soul prism that would store Illidan's soul long enough to transfer him inside  [Light's Heart]. However, Illidan's soul had been stolen out of the Nether and pulled into Helheim.[63] Xe'ra and the Illidari speculated that Gul'dan had struck a deal with Helya to retrieve and keep it there. After the death of Helya, his soul was put into the soul prism and then brought to Light's Heart which seemingly consumed it.[64] Light's Heart, with Illidan's soul inside, was brought to Archmage Khadgar with instructions to call forth the vessel's power when Gul'dan attempts to open the portal for Sargeras in order to release Illidan's soul into his body.[65]"
