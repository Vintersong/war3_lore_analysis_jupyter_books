text: "Kil'jaeden did not realize Illidan's capture of the Black Temple was an act against the Legion itself. Demons were conniving creatures that were known to betray each other for greater power. Kil'jaeden thought Illidan to be his servant that had claimed Outland as a personal prize, which Kil'jaeden would allow him to keep if Illidan destroyed the Lich King. However, if Illidan refused, Kil'jaeden threatened to do everything in his power to retake the broken world from Illidan and destroy him. Illidan feigned his thoughts and allegiance before Kil'jaeden once more and agreed to destroy the Lich King. He used one of the many portals on Outland and crafted a new gateway back to Azeroth. He took a portion of his army, leaving Akama to secure Outland, arrived to Northrend and began marching on Icecrown Citadel.[39]"
