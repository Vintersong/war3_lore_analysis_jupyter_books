text: "Illidan, with a new plan spurred into his mind, journeyed to Zin-Azshari. There he feigned allegiance to Azshara and Mannoroth. Illidan's plan was to obtain the Demon Soul, an artifact of great power created by Deathwing also known as Neltharion the Earth-Warder, which had the ability to close the portal which was allowing the demons to enter Kalimdor. However, to put this plan in action, Illidan had to gain more power. Illidan was eventually brought before Sargeras himself, who quickly discovered the night elf's plan to obtain the Demon Soul for the Legion. Sargeras was pleased with this plan and gave Illidan a \"gift\" in return for his allegiance. Illidan's eyes were burned out by Sargeras himself, despite still being beyond the portal, and orbs of mystic fire set in their place that allowed Illidan to see all forms of magic, and fel tattoos covered his body. When Illidan's eyes were burned out, he also received a vision of the true strength of the Legion and their crusade across infinite universes, and he came to realize that defeating them on Azeroth would mean nothing. He resolved then to find a way to defeat them for good.[26][27] Lady Vashj was among the handmaidens who nursed Illidan back to health, and handed him an amber scarf of the same color as his former eyes to cover his empty sockets.[28] Queen Azshara was fascinated by the \"new\" Illidan (who was wary of her advances), but remained cautious, sending Captain Varo'then to accompany Illidan in his search for the Demon Soul."
