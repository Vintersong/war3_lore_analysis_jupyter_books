text: "In response Gul'dan and the Shadow Council decided to ignore the Shadowmoon clan's warnings about the Dark Star, an ancient god of the Void that was actually the fallen naaru K'ara. They conducted a ritual to call on the Dark Star in their war against the draenei and channeled it at Karabor. A pillar of Void energy ripped through the heavens and slammed down on Karabor, driving many draenei defenders to madness while many others died instantly. Velen called on his powers to keep the Void at bay and rally the survivors to Karabor's harbor, but the Dark Star had forever darkened Karabor, and it became known as the Black Temple and was taken by the orcs.[4] After their defeat, the captured draenei clerics of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to Hellfire Citadel as prisoners of war. The warlock Teron'gor murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood outside of the walls.[5] While Hellfire Citadel was Warchief Blackhand's capital, Karabor became the clandestine Shadow Council's seat of ruling."
