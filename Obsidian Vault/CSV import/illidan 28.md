text: "Before he left for Antorus, Illidan created a crystal with messages for Malfurion, Tyrande, and the adventurer. After the events at the Seat of the Pantheon, the crystal was found aboard the Vindicaar and delivered to its recipients. To Malfurion, he spoke of how the teachings of Cenarius were not for him as they were for his brother, and how all the power he sought was not to conquer or rule, but to save Azeroth, despite Malfurion's distrust--though Illidan admitted he did not make it easy for Malfurion to do so. With his fate becoming clear, Illidan wished to finally quiet the strife that had long divided them and entrust the safety of the world to his brother, for there was no one he trusted to face threats more than him. While Malfurion had spent a lifetime fighting for the dream of what Azeroth could be, he now must fight for what it is. With his final words, Illidan asked Malfurion to take care of Tyrande and listen to her counsel, for she was always the best of them. The road ahead would be long, but whatever came, he knew Malfurion would bring honor to the name Stormrage."
