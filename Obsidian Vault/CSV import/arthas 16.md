text: When Uther was reunited with Jaina Proudmoore, the two shared their memories of Arthas, whom both had loved in their own ways, and Uther advised Jaina that she could choose to leave her painful memories of Arthas behind and instead carry her love forward with her so that it could lend her strength.[86] After Arthas' soul faded away, Jaina told adventurers that she felt conflicted about him, as he always thought he acted in the name of justice even when committing atrocities, and that she was one of the few who could still remember the prince he'd been and not just the monster he became.[87]
