text: "Upon meeting with Malfurion Stormrage, Tyrande Whisperwind, Shandris Feathermoon, and Maiev Shadowsong, Thrall noticed their frosty, rigid silence. Thrall subsequently formally apologized to the night elves, pointed out how Baine sought to overthrow Sylvanas and remove her as warchief, and cited Calia as an example how the Horde to change by revealing that Voss now spoke for the Forsaken and how both women sought to reforge themselves anew, free of Sylvanas, free of her poisonous influence. When the meeting started to dissolve into an argument about responsibility for Teldrassil, Thrall acknowledged the harm Varok Saurfang had done in the war, while reminding them that he did not intend for Teldrassil to burn and was killed by Sylvanas. When Tyrande stated she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Yukha attempted to corral the Horde leaders out of the area, but Thrall shrugged him and promised to give Tyrande what she was owed; the head of Sylvanas Windrunner causing her smile and declare, \"Do it, then, or never seek to speak with me again.\""
