text: "There was utter certainty in the naaru’s voice, and it communicated itself to Illidan.\nFor a moment, he felt the Light embrace him, and his heart was at rest. He had been\ngiven a vision of redemption beyond any he had hoped for. Peace filled him as he\ncommuned silently with the naaru. The moment lasted only a heartbeat, but when it\nended, Illidan felt as if it might have been a lifetime.\n“You will be a hero,” said the naaru. “But there will be a price.”\n“There always is.”\n* * *\nTHE MOMENT ENDED."
