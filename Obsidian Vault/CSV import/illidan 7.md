text: "When the Demon Soul came into the hands of the Legion, they went about using it as a focus to strengthen their portal above the Well of Eternity for Sargeras. Illidan reunited with the Kaldorei Resistance, which now greatly mistrusted him after seeming to betray them and hand over the key to victory to the demons. But working alongside Malfurion, the brothers worked together to close the portal with the Demon Soul's power. The destruction of the portal caused the Well of Eternity itself to grow unstable, and right before the defenders fled Zin-Azshari Illidan took several vials and filled them with water from the Well of Eternity. The Great Sundering that resulted from the Well's instability split the main supercontinent of Kalimdor into various smaller continents."
