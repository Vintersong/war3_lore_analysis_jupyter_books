text: Arthas worried that Kael'thas was right and that they would never reach the Citadel before Illidan could. However, Anub'arak revealed that they could use the ancient tunnels of Azjol-Nerub as a shortcut. With little choice, Arthas accepted the crypt lord's suggestion. While setting up a camp to fight to the passageway, Anub'arak suggested raiding the hoard of Sapphiron, an ancient blue dragon and servant of Malygos and using whatever treasures the dragon had to strengthen themselves. Not only did they slay the dragon, but Arthas used what power he had left to raise Sapphiron into a powerful frost wyrm.[47]
