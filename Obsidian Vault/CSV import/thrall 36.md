text: "There, they found Geth'xun, who had survived the fall as well. Though Thrall was severely injured, Mylra managed to distract Geth'xun while the adventurer picked up the Doomhammer, and then used it to defeat the demon. Thrall did not take the Doomhammer back, however. Since his battle with Garrosh, he felt as if it was a dead weight in his hands, he believed that the elements were silent to him. In reality, it was his guilt and internal struggle that were the reason for this.[95] He gave the Doomhammer to the adventurer and told them that they now wielded powers even he never tapped into. Thrall then asked the adventurer to bring the Earthen Ring together against the Legion, before going his own way.[96]"
