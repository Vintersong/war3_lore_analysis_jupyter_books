text: "When Xe'ra, restored through the efforts of Turalyon, Alleria Windrunner, and an adventurer, attempted to fulfill the destiny she had seen for Illidan through the Light, Illidan rejected her. Illidan stated that he had traded his freedom for power before. As the two got into an argument about Illidan embracing the Light and whether his destiny was his own, Xe'ra even bound Illidan in chains of light to force the prophecy to be fulfilled and forge Illidan a new life. Knowing that a new raid was demanded he stated that his life was not hers to take, Illidan ultimately broke free, declared his destiny is his own, and killed Xe'ra. Horrified, Turalyon cried that Illidan had doomed them all, called him Betrayer, and attempted to strike him down with the Great Royal Sword. Illidan blocked Turalyon's blow with his hand, telling him as fel blood leaked down his arm that his faith had blinded him and there was no chosen one--only they could save themselves.[16]"
