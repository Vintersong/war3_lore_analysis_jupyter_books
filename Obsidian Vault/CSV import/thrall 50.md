text: The image of a wolf was later added onto the Doomhammer to denote Thrall's hereditary ties to the Frostwolf clan, but little else has changed about the weapon. Through war and peace, the hammer has remained at Thrall's side, an embodiment of his race's strength as it was in ancient times, and a symbol of doom to the enemies who would dare threaten the orcs' freedom and honor.
