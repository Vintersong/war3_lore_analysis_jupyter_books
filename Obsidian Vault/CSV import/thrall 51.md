text: "The hammer remained in the leader of the Earthen Ring's possession and was used in tandem with other legendary artifacts and heroes to combat the Burning Legion. It was used to seal the power of the Sword of Sargeras after it was stabbed into Azeroth alongside the other gathered artifacts that the heroes of Azeroth had found to combat the demons. Drained of its mighty power, it is unknown as to the fate of the Doomhammer after this; as the Farseer either kept it or discarded it as another artifact was."
