text: Arthas could be seen as a "reverse" version of King Arthur. Frostmourne is comparable to the Sword in the Stone/Excalibur, Ner'zhul (or Kel'Thuzad) could be seen as roughly equivalent to Merlin (the wizard figure behind the king), and Uther shares his name with King Arthur's father. In contrast to Arthur, Arthas destroyed a Camelot-styled kingdom and built its opposite.  In addition, Jaina is to Arthas what Guinevere was to Arthur and both have an older sister (Morgana for Arthur and Calia for Arthas) who can wield supernatural power.
