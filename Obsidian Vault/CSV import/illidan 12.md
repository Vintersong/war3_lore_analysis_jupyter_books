text: "After the Legion's defeat, Illidan was visited by Kil'jaeden, who, while noting Illidan's sketchy track record with the Legion, offered him one final chance to serve them. He told him to seek out the Frozen Throne, and destroy it. Ner'zhul had grown far too powerful for Kil'jaeden to control and betrayed him, and Illidan was to remove him from the equation; in exchange for more power and magic than he could dream of.[33] He granted him the Orb of Kil'jaeden to aid him in this task."
