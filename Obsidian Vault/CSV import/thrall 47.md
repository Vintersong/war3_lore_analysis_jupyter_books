text: "Through blood the weapon shall pass, as surely as night begets day,\nUntil the elements cry unheard, and pride turns to unbridled rage.\nThe last of the line shall deliver salvation and doom upon his kind.\nHonor will be undone and all will be lost, before it is found again.\nA stranger will raise the hammer high, and with it justice shall reign."
