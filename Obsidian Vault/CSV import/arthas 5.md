text: "Arthas and his troops repelled the mages' vast counterattack as Kel'Thuzad began the lengthy summoning of the demon lord, reinforced by the Burning Legion's forces as the ritual progressed. Once Archimonde arrived, he proclaimed that the Lich King was of no further use to the Legion, and Tichondrius was placed in command of the Scourge. Arthas was left to wonder what would become of him and Kel'Thuzad, but the lich replied that all was going as the Lich King foresaw.[37] The pair disappeared as Archimonde took his revenge on the city, destroying Dalaran with a single powerful ritual.[38]"
