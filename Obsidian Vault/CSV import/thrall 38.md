text: "After the failed assassination attempt on Talanji, the Zandalari queen and a key ally, Thrall and the rest of the Horde leaders were forced into action. They empowered the young troll shaman Zekhan, still grieving the loss of Varok Saurfang, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. While Zekhan traveled to Dazar'alor to carry out his mission, Yukha agreed to serve as Thrall's messenger to the night elves, who had relocated to Nordrassil. Though Tyrande's rage had not lessened, she did agree on the meeting with the condition that Yukha inform Thrall that he \"must bring what is owed.\" A declaration that confused both orcs."
