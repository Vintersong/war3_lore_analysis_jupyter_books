text: "A faction of orcs exists in Outland, who remained untouched by demonic corruption. These orcs call themselves The Mag'har, and are comprised of various orcish clans who chose not to join Magtheridon's legion of fel orcs and appear to have been completely unaffected by the corruption wrought by Kil'jaeden. Thrall sent the Horde expedition to invade Outland in order to find and reconnect with the Mag'har.[72] Upon hearing the news that the expedition found them, Thrall immediately made plans to journey to Outland and make contact with the Mag'har. Eitrigg urged Thrall to make the proper preparations, instead of leaving Orgrimmar and the rest of the orcs on Azeroth open to attack.[73]"
