text: "With a great cry of strength, Arthas brought Frostmourne to bear against the Lich King's icy prison and with a haunting scream, the ice that encased the Frozen Throne and the armour exploded, and shards of the ice scattered on the ground. With Ner'zhul's helm at his feet, Arthas leaned forward, picked it up, and placed the unimaginably powerful artifact on his head."
