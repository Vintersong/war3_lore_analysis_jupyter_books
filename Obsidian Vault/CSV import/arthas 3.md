text: "Tichondrius tasked Arthas with gathering the members of the vile Cult of the Damned that were hiding in Vandermar, learning that Kel'Thuzad had expected him, much to his surprise. They aided him with their magical abilities as he traveled to Andorhal where he was to recover Kel'Thuzad's corpse. Arthas initially asked as to why they couldn't reanimate him on the spot, only to be informed by a cultist that a being like Kel'Thuzad required a powerful energy source. He confronted the paladin guarding the crypt, Gavinrad the Dire, who had given Arthas his holy warhammer at his induction ceremony into the Silver Hand. After killing Gavinrad, he recovered the remains of the necromancer. This brought Kel'Thuzad's ghost into being, and he secretly instructed Arthas not to trust the dreadlords. Arthas quietly contemplated this."
