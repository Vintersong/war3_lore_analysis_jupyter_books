text: "Following his fight with Arthas, Illidan fled to the shattered remains of Draenor (now known simply as Outland). Quickly gathering his followers, he soon declared himself Lord of Outland. According to the manual included with the Burning Crusade expansion, Illidan was fully aware that Kil'jaeden had not forgotten his failure to destroy the Frozen Throne. Anticipating the Legion's retaliation, and convinced that another offensive against Azeroth was not far behind, Illidan began to take drastic steps to prepare himself for a defensive stand. Beneath the Black Temple, Illidan began the creation of a new fel orc army of his own, using the blood of the imprisoned Magtheridon. As he continued to fortify the temple, his allies worked to ensure that all portals to Outland remained tightly sealed, buying Illidan even more time to strengthen his power base."
