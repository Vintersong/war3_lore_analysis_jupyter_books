text: "Go'el, confused, asked why the August Celestials were not more distressed at Garrosh's escape, as it was their duty to pronounce sentence. When asked by Taran Zhu what verdict they would have rendered they stated that Garrosh would live so he could continue to learn. They also said that Garrosh was not the only one on trial and Go'el realized that everyone there had been, and he accepted it completely. The Celestials also stated that they had all been judged and sentenced and that they now had to go back out into the world and do what they must. Eventually, all heads turned to Go'el, even though he was not in a position of leadership among them anymore. Humbly, Go'el spoke for all of them, stating that they would find Garrosh.[93]"
