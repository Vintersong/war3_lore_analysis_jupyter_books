text: "As Arthas returned to the capital city with Kel'Thuzad to discuss the threat, he was separated from Kel'Thuzad by the dreadlords, who attempted to kill him with several ghouls. Arthas killed the rogue undead and was forced to collect what loyalists he could find and fight his way through the dreadlords' forces, which included the powerful abomination Bloodfeast. As he arrived on the city's limits, he was saved by a cadre of banshees, who told him that Sylvanas had sent them to see him safely away.[45] However, as they neared an empty spot in the forest, Arthas received another vision from the Lich King, who told him he'd been betrayed. Sylvanas then appeared and shot him with a paralyzing arrow, promising to torture him like he had done to her. Before she could start, Kel'Thuzad stepped in and chased her off with his forces.[46]"
